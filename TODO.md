  * custom blocks ?

  * 2D histograms
  * complex and double matrices & vectors with a type param ?
  * finish special functions
  * remaining modules
  * polymorphic variants for FFT ?

CHECK
-----

  * complex matrices
  * BLAS functions

DONE
----

  * put .mli only modules back
  * complex funs in linalg and eigen
  * complex funs for vectmat sum types
  * rewrite siman in ML
  * drop gsl_fun type : use closures directly
  * check the "noalloc" directives in externals (removed most of them)
