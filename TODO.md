# To Do Status

## To do

- custom blocks ?

- 2D histograms
- complex and double matrices & vectors with a type param ?
- finish special functions
- remaining modules
- polymorphic variants for FFT ?

## Check

- complex matrices
- BLAS functions

## Done

- put .mli modules back
- complex funs in linalg and eigen
- complex funs for vectmat sum types
- rewrite siman in ML
- drop `gsl_fun` type: use closures directly
- check the "noalloc" directives in externals (removed most of them)
